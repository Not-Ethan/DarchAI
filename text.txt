The term "man's best friend" exists for a good reason. Dogs have been domesticated for at least 30,000 years or more. Dogs have been the faithful companions and loyal helpers of the human race throughout history. The bond between humans and dogs is unmistakable.
Cats seem to know that they were once worshiped as gods. Perhaps they resent the fact those days have ended. They may still be holding it against us. 
I think it's fair to say that a dog's human is the center of his universe. A cat is the center of its own universe. We humans are merely orbiting servants (willing servants, of course). 

Cats tend to stay home and do their own thing, or they go out and do their own thing. Some people have been known to walk their cats through the neighborhood on harnesses, but that's not the norm. 
Just like humans, dogs need plenty of exercise. The great thing is that we can make them part of our own exercise routines. Most dogs love to go on walks. Many enjoy running with their humans. Some can even be trained to run alongside a bike.
Many dogs make wonderful hiking companions. Also, dogs can participate in dog sports like agility, flyball, disc, and diving. Dog sports are great for fulfilling a dog's need for mental and physical exercise.

When's the last time you saw a cat in a vest working hard to help people? It's true that cats have an important place in animal-assisted therapy, but they're generally not as well-suited to other types of work the way dogs are. Dogs have been helping people just about as long as they've been on earth. They were working on farms as herders and drovers hundreds of years ago.

Today, many dogs still work on farms, and they serve even more noble purposes. They act as service dogs, guiding the blind, assisting the handicapped, helping the police and military, participating in search-and-rescue efforts, and comforting the sick. Some dogs can even detect seizures and sniff out cancer. That's some way to earn one's keep!
