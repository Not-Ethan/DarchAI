# DARCH AI: Debate Analysis, Research, and Content Highlighting

**DARCH** is a web application designed to streamline the research process for debaters. The tool helps users find evidence to support or refute arguments efficiently by automating the search, extraction, and summarization of relevant content from online articles. Users can save and review their findings to strengthen their debate cases.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up and log in to access their personalized research workspace via Google Oauth.
- **Argument-Based Search**: Enter an argument or topic, and the tool will use Google to find articles related to the argument.
- **Content Scraping and Highlighting**: Scrapes articles, **cuts the cards**, and compiles a word documuent with the following format:
  - **Bolded** text is considered to strongly support the arcument provided
  - <ins>Underlined</ins> text is whatever supports the bolded texts and considered secondary
  - Minimized text is considered not relevant but included to ensure full context for the article
- **Tagline Generation**: Generates a tagline for evidence based on the arguments contained within.
- **Evidence Storage**: Saves all articles, highlights, and summaries in a user-friendly interface for future reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for server-side functionality)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for web scraping and text analysis)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for user and data storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Not-Ethan/DarchAI.git
   cd DarchAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   API_KEY= your google developer key
   CSE= this is your google custom search engine id
   GCLIENT_ID= google api client id
   GCLIENT_SECRET= google api client secret
   PORT= the port the server will listen on. defaults to `3000`
   MONGO_PORT= port of mongodb database. defaults to `27017`
   HOSTNAME= the domain that the website is hosted on. defaults to `localhost`
   MAX_WORKERS= the number of argument searches that will be processed in parallel. defaults to 10
   ```

5. Start the application:
   Two files need to be ran
   ```bash
   node backend/app.js
   ```
   ```bash
   python AI_services/main.py

7. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. (or whatever port you set)

## Usage

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create an account or log in to access your workspace.
2. **Enter an Argument**: Type in the argument you want to research.
3. **Review Results**:
   - View scraped articles with highlighted evidence.
   - Read generated summaries for quick insights.
4. **Save and Organize**: Store research findings for future use in crafting debate cases.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: EJS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Flask
- **Web Scraping**: Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Python (spaCy, NLTK)
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Roadmap

- **Advanced Search Options**: Allow filtering by publication date, source credibility, and region.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Enable shared research workspaces for debate teams.
- **Improved Summarization**: Leverage advanced AI models for more nuanced summaries.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the tool.
