# DARCH AI: Debate Analysis, Research, and Content Highlighting

**DARCH** is a web application designed to streamline the research process for debaters. The tool helps users find evidence to support or refute arguments efficiently by automating the search, extraction, and summarization of relevant content from online articles. Users can save and review their findings to strengthen their debate cases.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up and log in to access their personalized research workspace via Google Oauth. \
- **Argument-Based Search**: Enter an argument or topic, and the tool will use Google to find articles related to the argument. \
- **Content Scraping and Highlighting**: Scrapes articles, **cuts the cards**, and compiles a word documuent with the following format:
  - **Bolded** text is considered to strongly support the arcument provided
  - <ins>Underlined</ins> text is whatever supports the bolded texts and considered secondary
  - Minimized text is considered not relevant but included to ensure full context for the article
- **Tagline Generation**: Generates a tagline for evidence based on the arguments contained within. \
- **Evidence Storage**: Saves all articles, highlights, and summaries in a user-friendly interface for future reference.
